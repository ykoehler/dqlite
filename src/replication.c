 *                  another connection, or an Open request to create a follower
 *                  connection has been submitted by and is in progress. The

 *                  triggered the write attempt. The client should then execute
 *                  a ROLLBACK and then decide what to do.
 *
 *  - SQLITE_IOERR: This is returned if we are not the leader when the hook
 *                  fires or if we fail to apply the Open follower command log,
 *                  in case no follower for this database is open yet. We

 *                  sqlite3PagerBegin that triggered the xBegin hook will

 *                  which will goto abort_due_to_error and finally call
 *                  sqlite3VdbeHalt, automatically rolling back the
